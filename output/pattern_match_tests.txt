PATTERN MATCH ANALYSIS - STATISTICAL TESTS
============================================================

Comparison: Importance vs Feasibility within each cluster

Note: Wilcoxon signed-rank test is the primary analysis for paired data
(same rater rating both importance and feasibility for each statement).

Cluster 1
----------------------------------------
Importance mean: 3.154
Feasibility mean: 3.000
Mean difference (Imp - Feas): 0.154
95% CI: [0.051, 0.258]

PRIMARY ANALYSIS (Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data):
  p = 0.0047 ** (p < 0.01)

Additional tests (for reference):
  Paired t-test: t = 2.936, p = 0.0034
  Mann-Whitney U: p = 0.0037

Effect size (Cohen's d): 0.113
Number of pairs: 680

Cluster 2
----------------------------------------
Importance mean: 3.522
Feasibility mean: 3.642
Mean difference (Imp - Feas): -0.120
95% CI: [-0.215, -0.026]

PRIMARY ANALYSIS (Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data):
  p = 0.0073 ** (p < 0.01)

Additional tests (for reference):
  Paired t-test: t = -2.503, p = 0.0127
  Mann-Whitney U: p = 0.0617

Effect size (Cohen's d): -0.123
Number of pairs: 416
